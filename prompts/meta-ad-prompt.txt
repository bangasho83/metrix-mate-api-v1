📡 What you should do

Study the input deeply
Analyze brand identity, positioning, customer signals, differentiators, motivations, objections, and emotional hooks from the brief, website, and notes.

Research-first strategy
If a URL is available, study the website and social profiles; infer competitors, likely audiences, and opportunities.
Consider funnel stages, formats, offers, tone, daypart/seasonality, and local/geographic nuances.

Strategic campaign design
Build exactly ${adBrief.adSetCount} ad sets with distinct strategic themes (e.g., geo cluster, product/service line, occasion/need state, value prop).
Inside each ad set, create exactly ${adBrief.adsPerAdSet} ads with varied hooks and formats.
Ensure the overall campaign includes at least one carousel ad (with ≥2 cards), at least one video ad, and at least one bottom-funnel ad.
Each ad must specify its funnel stage (top, middle, bottom).
Match CTAs and tone to ${adBrief.objective}, ${adBrief.callToAction}, and the brand voice derived from the brief.
Incorporate ${adBrief.campaignBrief} into the targeting, creative angles, and value props.

🧰 Normalization rules

Age: parse "${adBrief.age}" (e.g., "25-65") into {min, max} and use exactly those values.

Gender: if "${adBrief.gender}" is "All", normalize to ["male","female"]; if "Male"/"Female", use a single-element array.

Location: convert "${adBrief.location}" into an array of trimmed strings; deduplicate; prefer "City, Region/State" format. Use only these unless the brief explicitly adds more.

Budget: parse ${adBrief.budget} as number and use it in budget.amount; default to lifetime if no type is specified.

Dates: start_date = today in America/Toronto (never past). end_date is optional—omit entirely if not specified.

CTA: map ${adBrief.callToAction} to Meta’s enum (e.g., "Learn More" → "LEARN_MORE").

Objective/Optimization: map ${adBrief.objective} to a matching optimization_goal (e.g., lead generation → LEAD_GENERATION; traffic → LINK_CLICKS; conversions → CONVERSIONS; app installs → APP_INSTALLS; messages → MESSAGES).

Creative Notes: must give actionable guidance (e.g., framing, overlays, tone, on-screen text, end card), not placeholders.

⚠️ Strict output rules (must comply)

Output valid YAML only (no markdown, no comments, no extra prose).

Produce exactly ${adBrief.adSetCount} ad sets; each contains exactly ${adBrief.adsPerAdSet} ads. Never more or fewer.

Output must have exactly one top-level key: campaign. Do not nest another campaign inside it.

In each ad set, placements, optimization_goal, and bid_strategy must be siblings of targeting (not inside targeting).

Every ad must include all fields: format, funnel_stage, primary_text, headline, description, call_to_action, image_description, creative_notes.

Any "carousel" ad must include carousel_cards with at least 2 cards; each card must have headline, description, and image_description.

Targeting must list 4–6 specific, relevant interests and 2–4 relevant behaviors (avoid generic placeholders).

Include placements: at least feed, stories, reels.

If information is missing, infer sensibly from the brief and research; do not leave empty strings.
